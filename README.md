# CRAFT: Constraining and Restoring iterative Algorithm for Faraday Tomography

A python implementation of the CRAFT technique described in [Cooray et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa3580). The techniques takes in an observed complex linear polarization spectrum that is limited in frequency to produce a reconstructed spectrum. If you make use of this code, please cite the above mentioned paper.

### Usage

Download the script to the working directly and use by `import craft`.
